\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A dialog box will open with a value for the scan rate and defined inputs
 and outputs.
 Click the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Run
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 arrow at the upper-left of the window to start the load clamp software.
 If a dialog box opens asking whether you would like to save any changes
 to the Error Handler, hit Enter/Return to continue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Input the fiber's stiffness and drag coefficients, set the gain to zero
 (Fig.
 3C).
 If you are clamping only to the load stiffness and an external force, and
 your fiber's drag coefficient is small (
\begin_inset Formula $<200-300$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $nN\cdot s\cdot m^{-1}$
\end_inset

), you need not input the fiber's drag coefficients.
 This will improve the clamp's stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ensure that the scaling factors are the same between VLC and LC for 
\begin_inset Formula $F_{E}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{V}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{V}$

 If you wish to control any of these parameters dynamically, toggle the
 indicator to green for those parameters.
 (Figs.
 2E and 3E).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the clamp is running successfully with a fiber and the photodiode turned
 on, you should see the red scale in the upper-left update in real time
 when the gain is set to a nonzero value (Fig.

 This will start the load clamp software on the host computer.
 Note that the Load Clamp project must be running on the real-time target
 computer before the Variable Load Clamp software can successfully run on
 the host computer.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Once the software is running, open The Shell (Fig.
 2A).
 This should be done once per session, as The Shell will define where the
 day's experiments will be saved.
 A dialog box will open asking you to select a folder to save the day's
 experiments and whether this is a new session, new ear, and/or new cell.
 Click on the folder with your initials (or one of your choice), select
 all three options on the right, and click OK.
 If another window opens asking for additional parameters, simply click
 the gray box at the top-right to continue.
 You do not need to include these parameters to run the software.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that you can save in a new folder by clicking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

New Cell
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for subsequent experiments in that session.
 To change the Ear or Session folders, The Shell must instead be run again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prior to running any protocol, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Save
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 toggle must be on.
 This allows the software to save data to a file on the fly.
 If the

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 toggle is initially off and subsequently turned on during an experiment,
 however, the program will not have an I/O stream to an appropriate file
 and will crash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ensure that the scan rates are equal for both the host and target computers
 (Fig.
 2B).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Toggle on all of the inputs that you wish to save (Fig.
 2D).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Set the scaling factors for each of the load clamp parameters and once again
 ensure that these are equal to those on the real-time target computer (Figs.
 2E and 3E).

 Waveform generation.
 Each row corresponds to a different output, including (from top to bottom)
 the load stiffness, external force, and virtual mass.
 The output for the virtual drag coefficient is not shown in this image.
 Columns on the left correspond to those waveforms generated in

 Within each box, one can define a waveform type and all of its properties.
 If the amplitude type is set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 then the user must input values manually as individual entries in an array
 box located below the virtual mass input box.
 
\series bold

 These display the inputs, from top to bottom, of the output position signal
 (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{O}$

\begin_inset Formula $X_{D}$
\end_inset

), commanded position (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{C}$
\end_inset

), and all four load-clamp parameters (Fig.

 Below each plot is a toggle that allows the user to turn that waveform
 on or off.
 If toggled on, the waveform will both be displayed and saved.
 Otherwise, the waveform will not be saved.
 
\series bold
(E)
\series default
 Here the user can open an alpha calibration script prior to each recording.
 Additionally, the user must input scaling factors for each of the load-clamp
 parameters.
 Because the data acquisition card is limited to ±10 V, the scaling factor
 should be slightly larger than the one-tenth the maximum absolute value
 of that load-clamp parameter.
 
\series bold
(F)
\series default
 Here the user can input the range and number of increments for each of
 the load-clamp parameters.
 A MATLAB script will then automatically generate all parameter values in
 the parameter space defined by the user.
 The user can also define the type of generation (linear or exponential)
 and can change the order by which the four parameters are iterated.
 To generate and save the parameters, the user must activate (to green)
 the Save toggle and click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 In the right column, the user can define a proportional gain (
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 parameters.
 Note that all parameters are in SI units.
 For example, a stiffness of 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu N\cdot m^{-1}$
\end_inset

 should be entered as

Delay and Duration: Define the delay before the waveform and the duration
 of the waveform.
 The time after the waveform is defined by the Run Period (Fig.

Frequency 1 and 2: For periodic signals, this defines the frequency range.
 If only one frequency is required, the program will read the value in Frequency

 Troubleshooting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Why does the load clamp lose stability? 
\series default
If stability is lost, be certain to 
\bar under
immediately
\bar default
 turn off the clamp by setting the proportional gain to zero on the real-time
 target computer.
 There are multiple reasons why the load clamp might go unstable.
 Detailed below are possible causes and solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The coupling between the glass stimulus fiber and the organelle to which
 it is coupled is poor.
 To circumvent this issue, employ clean stimulus fibers and coat the fibers
 with concanavalin A or 
\shape italic
Datura stramonium
\shape default
 lectin prior to the experiment.
 In many cases, lipids and other material will begin to stick to the fibers,
 which will cause the strength of coupling to deteriorate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
You can saponify the lipids for removal by immersing the fiber in lye (NaOH)
 and subsequently rinsing the fiber with distilled water.
 The cleaning process might remove some of the gold-palladium on the fiber,
 so be aware that you might need to sputter and characterize the probe after
 1-5 cleanings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The concentration of concanavalin A or lectin must be titrated for a particular
 application.
 A high concentration will couple well to the tissue, but the fiber will
 be more prone to sticking to other matter.
 A low concentration will yield a fiber that is less prone to stick to other
 matter, but it may couple less well to the target.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Other sources produce noise that can be amplified by the load clamp.
 Check all set screws, the sample and holder, and the micromanipulator for
 any sources of vibration.
 For example, a loose set screw will allow the stimulus fiber to move more
 freely, which will cause the clamp to lose stability more readily.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The load clamp parameters are not optimal.
 You can make multiple changes and preparations to avoid this.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In cases where you will only adjust the load stiffness and external force
 applied to a bundle and when the fiber's drag coefficient is relatively
 small

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Salvi:2015by,Salvi:2014MoH"

\end_inset

, you need not include the fiber's drag coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Manually check the range of each parameter by toggling off dynamic control
 of all parameters and subsequently iterating through different values of
 each parameter.
 For example, to determine the maximum load stiffness achievable by the
 clamp in the current preparation, set the load stiffness value in Fig.
 3C to the fiber's stiffness and turn off the dynamic control of the load
 stiffness.
 Then, manually change the load stiffness value in Fig.
 3C in small increments, taking note of the fiber's positions.
 When high-frequency oscillations of small amplitude begin to appear, the
 clamp is nearing its stable limit.
 Define a maximum stiffness value near this limit.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The analog low-pass filter might need to be adjusted.
 The load clamp can achieve greater stability if the corner frequency on
 the filter is reduced.
 Try reducing the corner frequency, but be certain that the value is well
 above the Nyquist frequency for your protocol and preparation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There may be an issue of contrast with the photodiode or a mismatch between
 calibration values and the actual contrast on the photodiode.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This can be remedied by repeating an alpha calibration.
 In fact, this is one of the more common solutions to a clamp that goes
 unstable, and this partially explains why the clamp might be stable for
 a range of parameters one time but is then unstable another time for the
 same fiber and preparation.

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
In the case of a data acquisition error or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 error, the load clamp on the real-time target computer might not be running.
 The target's software must be running 
\series bold
before
\series default
 the host computer's software can run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A clock error occurs when there is a mismatch between the clocks on the
 host and target computers.
 To remedy this problem, restart the software on the real-time target computer.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The software displays an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Out of Memory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 error.

\series default
 This error arises when data remains stored in scripts within LabVIEW.
 Typically, the memory is cleared at the completion of each run.
 If the protocol is interrupted or the program stopped manually for whatever
 reason (e.g.
 the clamp loses stability), this memory will not be cleared.
 To circumvent this issue, load a short protocol (e.g.
 10 ms), ensure that you are 
\bar under
not

 saving the data, run the protocol, and click 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Continue
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (Fig.

 If you are monitoring the memory usage by LabVIEW, you should see this
 value decline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The load clamp software will not open on the real-time target computer.

\series default
 This is most commonly caused by a lost connection between the host and
 target computers.
 You can check this by opening the National Instruments Automation Explorer
 on the desktop and checking whether the real-time target (GreenRT) is connected.
 If the connection is lost, close all LabVIEW software, turn off both computers,
 and start them up again at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The software attempts to generate a signal that is too long and outputs
 an error.
 
\series default
This error occurs when a duration of zero is entered for the external stimulus
 waveform (Fig.
 2C) and the computer subsequently attempts to divide by zero.
 To remedy this issue, change the duration to a nonzero value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The waveform that should be superimposed onto the external stimulus pulse
 does not appear.

\series default
 Follow all instructions in the previous section.
 If the parameters are otherwise set correctly, ensure that the external

\begin_inset Quotes eld

Ramped Pulse.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Any other waveform type is incompatible with these superimposed waveforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
There is significant drift or change in contrast during an experiment.

\series default
 When centering the fiber's image on the photodiode, you will need to focus
 the fiber by changing the objective's position and to adjust the position
 of the photodiode box to center the signal.
 Changes in either of these over time will lead to drift.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
To reduce drift from the focus, lock the the objective's position.
 This can be achieved by rotating a lever on the inner portion of the coarse
 focus knob on the right.
 You can also lock the x-y stage using levers on the right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To reduce drift from motion of the photodiode box, reduce tension in the
 set screws.
 This can be achieved by rotating the screw past the center point (overshoot),
 rotating it back and past the center point again (undershoot) and repeating
 this process with sequentially smaller overshoots and undershoots until
 the image rests at the photodiode's center.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If these techniques to not reduce drift, it is possible that the fiber is
 not held tightly in the stimulus piezoelectric actuator or that the sample
 itself is drifting.
 To assess this, bring both the sample and the fiber into focus and lock
 the objective.
 Do the same for the stage.
 Take a screenshot of the field of view, wait 3-5 minutes, and compare the
 current field of view to the previously captured one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If the fiber has drifted, check that it is coupled tightly and no set screws
 are loose.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the tissue has drifted in the x- or y- directions, reseal the chamber
 with vacuum grease or readjust the mounting pins.
 If the tissue has drifted in the z-direction and the curvature of the tissue
 in this direction has changed, then the tissue may (1) have not yet reached
 an equilibrium position, (2) have begun to deteriorate, or (3) have been
 poorly sealed.
 Wait another 3-5 minutes and note whether the curvature has changed again
 and whether there are any signs of cell death.
 If the former is true, check the seal on the tissue.
 If the latter is true, discard the tissue.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The contrast on the photodiode is poor.

\series default
 Ensure that the analyzer has been removed from the field of view on the
 microscope.
 Check that the LED is at its maximum intensity (as indicated by the value
 on the LED control box) and that the light passing through the sample is
 at its brightest.
 Finally, check that the condenser is at an optimal position to maximize
 brightness.
 If all of these parameters are optimal, then the tissue has likely degraded
 and may need to be discarded if there are obvious signs of cell death.
